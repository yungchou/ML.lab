Tuning parameter 'intercept' was held constant at a value of TRUE


#-------------------------------
Ridge Regression

Tuning parameter 'alpha' was held constant at a value of 0
RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.
The final values used for the model were 
alpha = 0 and lambda = 5094.138.

#-------------------------------
Lasso Regression

Tuning parameter 'alpha' was held constant at a value of 1
RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.
The final values used for the model were 
alpha = 1 and lambda = 84.97534.

#-------------------------------
Elastic Net

RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.
The final values used for the model were 
alpha = 0.012 and lambda
 = 1668.101.
